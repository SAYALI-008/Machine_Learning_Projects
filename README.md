The folder contains Machine learning Project details with problem statements and their respective datasets

1. Johnson and Johnson Hackathon- Analysis of UCI diabetes dataset-
   Prediction of patients readmission in US based hospitals (~130) within a span of 30 days.
   This includes performing EDA to find excellent insights about the drugs and departments in hospitals affecting the patient readmission
   Performed predictive modelling for imputation and Feature Selection by RF 
   Applied models like logistic regression, Decision Trees and Ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost along with hyperparameter tuning
   Results - 95% accuracy on Random Forest

2. Predicting Airline Passenger Survey Satisfaction
   Using ML basic pipeline-
   and extracting features like - Online boarding, Inflight wifi service, Type of Travel, Inflight entertainment, Customer Type, Checkin service, Class, Baggage handling, Gate location,            Age, Seat comfort, Inflight service, Cleanliness and Flight Distance.
   A binary classification problem was tackled
   Implemented models including KNN, Decision Trees and Random Forest and evaluated on metrics Recall - to detect all dissatisfied passengers to improve service quality and Precision - to identify truly dissatisfied customers and reach out to them.
   Using decision trees with an accuracy of 95.3% the EDA insights were The Eco class passengers are highly dissatisfied. Passengers boarding in for personal travel too are quite dissatisfied.
   Investigate the reasons for dissatisfaction on shorter flights. Are there differences in service quality on shorter routes? could be answered.
